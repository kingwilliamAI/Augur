 * Turns the model's per-feature contributions into the three lines shown under a score.
 *
 * The phrasing states the observed fact and the direction, never a recommendation. A reason is only
 * shown if the model actually used it for this launch, so a card never explains a score with
 * something that did not move it.
 *
 * Each reason carries two phrasings of the same fact. The card has a column to itself and gets the
 * sentence; a row in the feed has about a fifth of one and gets the label. Truncating the sentence
 * with CSS produced "graduation needs 4.20 of the quo…" three times over — three chips that looked
 * different, said nothing, and were indistinguishable from one another at a glance.
